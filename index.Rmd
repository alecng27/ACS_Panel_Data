The **American Community Survey (ACS)** is a demographics survey program conducted by the **U.S. Census Bureau**. 

**ACS** regularly gathers information previously contained only in the long form of the decennial census, such as `ancestry`, `citizenship`, `educational attainment`, `income`, `language proficiency`, `migration`, `disability`, `employment`, and `housing characteristics`. These data are used by many public-sector, private-sector, and not-for-profit stakeholders to allocate funding, track shifting demographics, plan for emergencies, and learn about local communities.

For this project, I utilized the **2019 ACS data** to explore and compare the **2020 US Presidential Election results** against the county-level demographic data.

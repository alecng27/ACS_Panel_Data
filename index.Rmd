# About {-}

The American Community Survey (ACS) is a demographics survey program conducted by the U.S. Census Bureau. 

ACS regularly gathers information previously contained only in the long form of the decennial census, such as ancestry, citizenship, educational attainment, income, language proficiency, migration, disability, employment, and housing characteristics. These data are used by many public-sector, private-sector, and not-for-profit stakeholders to allocate funding, track shifting demographics, plan for emergencies, and learn about local communities.

For this project, I utilized the 2019 ACS data to explore and compare the 2020 US Presidential Election results against the county-level demographic data.
